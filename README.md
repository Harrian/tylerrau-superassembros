THis is my final project for CSC314 Assembly Language! I hope you enjoy it

Note, this project is really old, and even though I had the source code still,
I'm not sure which files were generated by the compilation process and which are
needed source files. So for the time being I've just included everything that was
in the project directory that I had.

I can say the meat of this project is the `mario.asm` file.

I don't remember the server environment exactly at my school but I think it was
x86_64 based running debian jessie and this project used 32 bit.
